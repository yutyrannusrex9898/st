# I've started to think about mega knight in completely normal irl situations.
There was an old lady walking with her grandkids at the store and it kind of reminded me of the witch with her skeletons. In my head i was just thinking how satisfying it would be if i dropped an mk to instakill all those skellys and take care of the witch after.
